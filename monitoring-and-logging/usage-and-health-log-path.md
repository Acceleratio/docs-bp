### Issue description

This check determines whether the SharePoint Usage and Health Log Files are stored on the primary drive.

### Explanation

SharePoint writes usage and health data to the logging folder and logging database. Usage and Health logs can be used to trace various events, like File I/O, SQL I/O usage, Page Requests, SQL Latency usage and many more. Default location of the logging folder is C:Program FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft SharedWeb Server Extensions<HIVE number, e.g. 12, 14 or 15>/LOGS. Depending on the number of users accessing the system and the logging events configured, writing to a log can have a massive impact on the file systemâ€™s performance. Therefore, it is highly recommended that trace logs be stored on a dedicated drive.

### Solution

Make sure that the trace log files are not stored on the same drive as the primary (system) drive or the paging file. To do so, go to the __Central Administration__ > __Monitoring__ > __Reporting__ > __Configure usage and health data collection__. You can use this page to configure logging level and trace log settings. Specify a new location under __Usage Data Collection Settings__ > __Log file location__ and click __OK__.

Please note that this is a farm wide setting. This means that the path you specify here must be physically available and accessible on each SharePoint server in your farm.

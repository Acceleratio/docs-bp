### Issue description

This check determines whether the IIS Log files are stored on the primary drive.

### Explanation

The log files generated by IIS can consume a lot of space and could potentially fill an entire hard drive. This can cause many problems if logs are being stored on the primary drive, which is usually the C: drive. The default path is %SystemDrive%inetpublogsLogFiles.

### Solution

A couple of solutions for this problem are outlined in the following article. Whenever possible, we recommend moving the log folder to a secondary drive or a network share. The default log folder can be changed at IIS Manager > Connection Pane > Logging.

If you have multiple web front-end servers in your SharePoint farm, donâ€™t forget to update them all.

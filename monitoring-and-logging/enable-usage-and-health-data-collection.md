### Issue description

This check determines whether the SharePoint Usage and Health Log data collection is enabled. This can provide an insight into the functioning of the system itself; however, it can also introduce additional load to the system and fill the hard drive on which the log files are stored.

### Explanation

SharePoint writes usage and health data to the logging folder and logging database. Usage and Health logs can be used to trace various events, like File I/O, SQL I/O usage, Page Requests, SQL Latency usage and many more. Default location of the logging folder is C:Program FilesCommon FilesMicrosoft SharedWeb Server Extensions<HIVE number, e.g. 12, 14 or 15>/LOGS. Depending on the number of users accessing the system and the logging events configured, writing to a log can have a massive impact on the file systemâ€™s performance.

### Solution

Make sure that only required events are selected for the data collection. To do so, go to the __Central Administration__ > __Monitoring__ > __Reporting__ > __Configure usage and health data collection__. You can use this page to configure logging level and log settings. In the case you want to turn off the Usage and __Health data collection__, under Health Data Collection clear the check box near __Enable Health Data Collection__ and click __OK__.

### Issue Description
This check determines whether the TempDB database is configured properly and according to the best practices.
### Explanation
SharePoint Server uses SQL Server to store configuration and user data. SQL Server stores data over the various file types. The TempDB system database is a global resource that is available to all users connected to the instance of SQL Server. It is used to hold the following:

* Temporary user objects that are explicitly created, such as global or local temporary tables, temporary stored procedures, table variables, or cursors.

* Internal objects that are created by the SQL Server Database Engine, for example, work tables to store intermediate results for spools or sorting.

* Row versions that are generated by data modification transactions in a database that uses read-committed row versioning isolation or snapshot isolation transactions.
* Row versions that are generated by data modification transactions for features, such as: online index operations, Multiple Active Result Sets (MARS), and AFTER triggers.

Testing and user data show that insufficient disk I/O for tempdb can significantly impede overall farm performance. 

To avoid this issue, allocate dedicated disks for the drive that stores tempdb data files. For best performance, use a RAID 10 array for the drive that stores tempdb data files. 

The number of tempdb files should be the same as the number of processor cores present on the SQL server. If the number of logical processors is greater than 8, use 8 data files and then if contention continues, increase the number of data files by multiples of 4. Additionally, all file sizes should be equal

If data and log files must share disks due to space limitations, put files that have different usage patterns on the same disk to minimize concurrent access requests.
### Solution
Check the database file distribution. To do so, open the **SQL Server Manager** on the database server and check properties for every database. The page **File** in the **Properties** window contains the information about physical location of the database files. 

In case you need to move the database files to another drive or server, please read the articles referenced in the **Additional information** section.

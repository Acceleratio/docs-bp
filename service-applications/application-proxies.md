### Issue description

This check determines whether all deployed service application proxies are started. If a service application proxy is not started, it will render the service application inaccessible for the SharePoint farm, depending on service applications and web applications.

### Explanation

Service application proxies (or service connections) offer endpoints for accessing a particular service application. This is basically a virtual link between service applications and consumers (like web applications or other service applications). If a service application proxy is not started, that particular service application wonâ€™t be available for consumers to use.

### Solution

Verify that all service application proxies are up and running. To do so, go to the __Central Administration__ > __Application Management__ > __Service Applications__ > __Manage Service Applications__.

To start a service application proxy, start the __SharePoint 2013 Management Shell__ as an administrator and run the following script. Remember to change the State Service Proxy to the name the service application proxy you wish to start.
```powershell
$saProxy = Get-SPServiceApplicationProxy | where {$_.TypeName -eq "State Service Proxy"} 
$saProxy.Provision()
```
You can also filter by other Application Proxy attributes or use the following script to list all the Service proxies that are not online:

```powershell
Get-SPServiceApplicationProxy | where {$_.Status -ne "Online"} 
```

## Issue Description
This check determines whether the SharePoint farm is in trial.
## Explanation
If you are using the trial version of the product, you will need a valid license key to continue when the trial expires. The trial version is valid for 180 days from installation, after which your farm should be upgraded to the full version.
## Solution
Your license status can be checked through Central Administration. You can license the full version by paying for a license key, then navigating to **Central Administration** > **Upgrade and Migration** > **Convert Farm License Type**, where you enter the key.
